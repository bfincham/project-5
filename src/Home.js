                        The Baltimore Area Triathlon Club (BATC) is a USAT-registered Triathlon club
                        based in the Baltimore metropolitan area. Our club offers guidance and support
                        in the sport of Triathlon to individuals of all ages and abilities. We focus on
                        the three endurance sports of Triathlon (Swimming, Biking and Running), but many
                        of our members participate in many other sports as well. The club convenes monthly
                        meetings, which are held at various venues throughout Baltimore. We invite speakers,
                        coaches and sponsors to present various aspects of Triathlon. Members enjoy club-sponsored
                        food and drink. <br/><br/>We occasionally have raffles for goodies provided by our sponsors.
                        Members receive regular emails about upcoming events such as workouts, socials,
                        free clinics, mock races, and race course previews. Our popular Swim-Bike-Run (SBR)
                        workouts are sprint-length mock-races (1/2 mi swim, 14mi bike ride, 5K run). SBRs are
                        held regularly throughout the race season at the Hammerman area of Gunpowder Falls State
                        Park â€” site of the Baltimore Triathlon. <br/><br/>You can find the club well represented
                        at manylocal races with banners and a club tent staffedby volunteers who support their fellow
                        club members with club-sponsored food, drink, camaraderie and (of course) trash talk.
                        Our modest annual dues ($35) cover the cost of food, drink, venues, race support,
                        coaching, clinics and insurance. Finally, our corporate sponsors provide substantial
                        discounts to members. The value of the discounts easily exceed the cost of the dues.
                        We welcome individuals of all abilities and ages. Many of our members have no history
                        of participation in organized athletics in high-school or college. <br/><br/>Many simply caught
                        the bug (much) later in life. For individuals who are just starting out, and would like
                        some extra support, the club runs a New Triathlete Program with a training plan, newbie
                        clinics and individually assigned club mentors to guide novices to a fun and successful
                        first triathlon. If you are not already a member, check us out! Attend one of our open
                        monthly meetings or attend our club-sponsored SBR workouts. If you chose to attend an
                        SBR as a non-member, just introduce yourself to the workout leader/director and sign a
                        waiver (for insurance purposes).<br/><br/> We predict you will love it and join us!
